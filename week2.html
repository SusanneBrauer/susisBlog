        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
          Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet. i will be using
          this page to learn a little coding. I'm currently embarking on a
          <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com" target="_blank"
            >#100DaysOfCode</a
          >
          journey and I will be documenting this on here as well as use this as
          a practice piece.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this being a practice piece it will likely go through quiete a few
          changes over time so I hope you can bare with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          the urrent plan is to complete a Full stack developer course I'm doing
          on
          <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">CodeCademy</a>
          (which I do not count to the time for the 100 day challenge) and on
          the side practice what I learn on this block as well as on a a little
          project for tracking details about Sims in The Sims 4&#8482;. I know
          this might strike people as an odd choice of project but it is a
          franchise that has been close to my heart since it first released and
          I feel that there is a lot potential for me to practice a large number
          of technologies on it. Since I need to start with some layout work on
          that first I am starting my practice in this little blog.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the moment this will only be about my coding journey, but I will
          see if I add more other content to it eventually.

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> After a week of medical things to sort and getting back into my day job I'm finally back on this journey.<br>
              I have started with finishing off the Flexbox section of my CodeCademy Course and I do love flexbox there are so many possibilities. The project was essentiall writing up a little website and styling it using flexbox , but it also needed soemposition ing things that I was happy to practice. I got on rather well with that project. There is a link to the compled project below just look for the CodeCademy Project Tea Cozy in the link section below. If you want to see the concept that was given as a guideline to what the project was meant to look like you can find that in the respective repository on my github.<br>
              With the might of flexbox at my hands I some work on the navigation for the blog and finally implemented the week nav as well as some additional cleaning up. There is a few more things I want to clean up. I also added some additional future weeks so I can just go and fill them in as I go along, which will make updating this blog a bit quicker (so far up to week 4, the other weeks will still be empty links).<br>
              I hope I can do some work tomorrow but I will have to see how much I will get to do after my morning appointment.

            <p>
              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> It's been A slow day since I was recovering from sedation after a medical appointment in the morning, but I managed to at elast do some of the course. Going more into CSS grid and I'm looking forward to try it on my projects. The course was mostly working with boxes. Which mde me think that made just working with empty divs to set up the layout before filling them with the actual content maybe the way forward.<br>
              I spotted a retweet with a list of CSS exercises to do, which was tweeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/codewithibrahim" target="_blank">@codewithibrahim</a>, and I will look to have a look at these in the next couple of days. I will post the list here as well but this is the original <a href="https://twitter.com/codewithibrahim/status/1505798191739981826" target="_blank">thread</a>.

              <strong>Today's Progress:</strong> CSS grid and relative sizing for responsive designs
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> Diving deeper into CSS grid was exciting. I think the possibilities of combining grid and flexbox could be rather interesting.<br>
              Maybe I'll finally be able to get a better handle on making sites more responsive, that has previous been difficult for me. I pushed through more of the course than I planned but that cost me the time to work on the Landing page practice, but I will dive into that first thing tomorrow.<br>
              One great take away for me from today was the difference between 'em' and 'rem'. I knew there were options for sizing, but not quite got their difference. In the end it's not that hard as the R in 'rem' identifies it as relating to the root element. But then I also mistakenigly thought that the root would be the body element and not actually the html element.

              <strong>Today's Progress:</strong> the mystery of responsiveness
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> Finished all the learning fro responsive design, next up is the project. Time to use all I learned about grid, flexbox and media queries in that project. I have always struggled with responsiveness, but I have high hopes that I can get it right this time.<br>
              As planned I also had a look at the landing page exercise on freeCodeCamp that is link in my to-do list for the day it was more of work along tutorial that includes first bit of JavaScript as well, so I have decided to wait to attack that exercise when I dived more into Javascript. Nect up are some practice projects for resposiveness.

              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> I had a bit of a rough day health wise, so it was a slow day. I did the planning for the company site CodeCademy project and decided to take a friends studio as example object. I planned the layout and collect assessts ready to get strated tomorrow when I feel better. Overall not much actual coding today but I'm all set to make a start tomorow.

              <strong>Today's Progress:</strong> Most complex practice project yet
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> I made a start setting up the html and styling for my company site project using Flexbox and CSS Grid. I will add responsiveness in the next step. I'm very happy so far about how smoothly layout works with CSS grid. I did mainly use rules related to columns for this but it felt like the right thing to do for this project. I will say that I think I would proably use different pages for this site rather than stacking everything like I have here, but for the purpose of this exercise this will be fine and keep things all in one html file.<br>
              At the end I would like ot say that I used my friends studio as practice object. That studio is <a href="https://www.blacktreestudios.co.uk/bts/" target="_blank">BlackTree Studio</a> in the UK which is an amazing place for any recording of video or audio, so if you ever need anything like that please check them out. The song used in the "Work Samples" section has been recorded and produced there with me singing.

            <p>The picture above shows the current stus of the CC practice project. I'm especially happy with the little blurred edge on the background image in the banner done with an inset box shadow: <code>box-shadow: 0 0 10px 8px #222222 inset;</code>. The colors are bsed on the colors of the actual website which is also where I have taken the pictures and tests from.<br>
            The Markings shown in the screen shot are from a great functionality the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/developer/" target="_blank">Firefox Developer Edition</a> offers, which makes working with grid and flexbox even more accessible and controllable. I'm not sure the other browsers offer this but I have only spotted it in there. I think I'll be mainly use this browser to preview sites I work on in the wip phase.<br>
            As always I'm tracking my work on this project in my github so if you are intersting at looking at it more closely that is the place to go.</p>

              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> I'm happy to report I successfully implemented responsiveness to this practice project and working out some fitting breakpoints. And I can now confidently say the CSS grid made working with responsiveness pretty smooth. See the picture below for how it turned out.

              Further down in the services section I even managed to hide an addition image in the smaller screen for improved readability which I was rather proud of. and I added some testimonies in the form of card type elements which change on 2 diferent breakpoints, will add them in an image below. overall I'm pleased with the responsiveness of the page and I think it is the first time I have gotten a page to a level of responsiveness I'm happy with.

I have done a little mor work on my coding and my little projects which I will write an update on for then picking up <a href="week3.html">week 3</a>. I am planning to ge back to doing some daily work and go back to documenting this in this blog type thing. as far as the work on the projcts go hopefully you should still get a fairly consistent idea about the work I hav done. Fingers crossed my health will get more stable so I can keep up the daily work going forward.</p>
