        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
          Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet. i will be using
          this page to learn a little coding. I'm currently embarking on a
          <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com" target="_blank"
            >#100DaysOfCode</a
          >
          journey and I will be documenting this on here as well as use this as
          a practice piece.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this being a practice piece it will likely go through quiete a few
          changes over time so I hope you can bare with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          the urrent plan is to complete a Full stack developer course I'm doing
          on
          <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">CodeCademy</a>
          (which I do not count to the time for the 100 day challenge) and on
          the side practice what I learn on this block as well as on a a little
          project for tracking details about Sims in The Sims 4&#8482;. I know
          this might strike people as an odd choice of project but it is a
          franchise that has been close to my heart since it first released and
          I feel that there is a lot potential for me to practice a large number
          of technologies on it. Since I need to start with some layout work on
          that first I am starting my practice in this little blog.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the moment this will only be about my coding journey, but I will
          see if I add more other content to it eventually.

              <strong>Today's Progress:</strong> Back on track! CodeCademy flexbox project. Flexbox is mighty!
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> After a week of medical things to sort and getting back into my day job I'm finally back on this journey.<br>
              I have started with finishing off the Flexbox section of my CodeCademy Course and I do love flexbox there are so many possibilities. The project was essentiall writing up a little website and styling it using flexbox , but it also needed soemposition ing things that I was happy to practice. I got on rather well with that project. There is a link to the compled project below just look for the CodeCademy Project Tea Cozy in the link section below. If you want to see the concept that was given as a guideline to what the project was meant to look like you can find that in the respective repository on my github.<br>
              With the might of flexbox at my hands I some work on the navigation for the blog and finally implemented the week nav as well as some additional cleaning up. There is a few more things I want to clean up. I also added some additional future weeks so I can just go and fill them in as I go along, which will make updating this blog a bit quicker (so far up to week 4, the other weeks will still be empty links).<br>
              I hope I can do some work tomorrow but I will have to see how much I will get to do after my morning appointment.

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> It's been A slow day since I was recovering from sedation after a medical appointment in the morning, but I managed to at elast do some of the course. Going more into CSS grid and I'm looking forward to try it on my projects. The course was mostly working with boxes. Which mde me think that made just working with empty divs to set up the layout before filling them with the actual content maybe the way forward.<br>
              I spotted a retweet with a list of CSS exercises to do, which was tweeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/codewithibrahim" target="_blank">@codewithibrahim</a>, and I will look to have a look at these in the next couple of days. I will post the list here as well but this is the original <a href="https://twitter.com/codewithibrahim/status/1505798191739981826" target="_blank">thread</a>.

              <strong>Today's Progress:</strong> CSS grid and relative sizing for responsive designs
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> Diving deeper into CSS grid was exciting. I think the possibilities of combining grid and flexbox could be rather interesting.<br>
              Maybe I'll finally be able to get a better handle on making sites more responsive, that has previous been difficult for me. I pushed through more of the course than I planned but that cost me the time to work on the Landing page practice, but I will dive into that first thing tomorrow.<br>
              One great take away for me from today was the difference between 'em' and 'rem'. I knew there were options for sizing, but not quite got their difference. In the end it's not that hard as the R in 'rem' identifies it as relating to the root element. But then I also mistakenigly thought that the root would be the body element and not actually the html element.
