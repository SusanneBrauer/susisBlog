## Purpose

This is going to be a blog to document my coding journey with the 100 day of code challenge and to practice at the same time.

## Technologies

- HTML

## Plans

as this is a learning by doing project I have started the blog in blank HTML. CSS styling will be added shortly as I move along on my journey learning more skills.
I'm considering adding other content then the documenting the journey, but I have not yet decided. I will cross that bridge when I get there.
