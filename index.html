        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
          Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet. i will be using
          this page to learn a little coding. I'm currently embarking on a
          <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com" target="_blank"
            >#100DaysOfCode</a
          >
          journey and I will be documenting this on here as well as use this as
          a practice piece.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this being a practice piece it will likely go through quiete a few
          changes over time so I hope you can bare with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          the urrent plan is to complete a Full stack developer course I'm doing
          on
          <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">CodeCademy</a>
          (which I do not count to the time for the 100 day challenge) and on
          the side practice what I learn on this block as well as on a a little
          project for tracking details about Sims in The Sims 4&#8482;. I know
          this might strike people as an odd choice of project but it is a
          franchise that has been close to my heart since it first released and
          I feel that there is a lot potential for me to practice a large number
          of technologies on it. Since I need to start with some layout work on
          that first I am starting my practice in this little blog.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the moment this will only be about my coding journey, but I will
          see if I add more other content to it eventually.

              <strong>Today's Progress:</strong> Planned for the journey ahead
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> I think doing the CodeCademy course from
              the start and working on the Portfolio website is a good start. The
              Sims Tracker will be a bit of a left field thing to work on but I
              think I can work with a number of technologies of it and maybe some
              other plays find it useful in the end. I also need to have another
              look at my portfoliosite to se what I want to hange and to add the
              missing responsiveness.
            </p>
            <p>So essentially there will be 3 work streams:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>CodeCademy Full Stack Path</li>
              <li>Update and improve portfolio website</li>
              <li>Create Sims Tracker</li>
              <li>blog for direct practice documenting the journey</li>
            </ol>
            <p>

            <p><strong>Todays plan:</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Finish the HTML Fundamentals Chapter on the course&#9745;</li>
              <li>Layout the Sims Tracker landing page&#9745;</li>
              <li>Layout the Sims Tracker household summary&#9744;</li>
              <li>Layout the Sims Tracker single Sim summary&#9744;</li>

              <strong>Today's Progress:</strong> Studying, layouting and my little
              blog
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> I have completed the HTML chapter of my
              course, I really like the idea of the semantic tags. I have then
              used the HTML to start writing this little blog using those skills
              as my practice for the day.<br />My project, which will be a website
              to track details for Sims in The Sims 4&#8482;, still needs some
              layout work before I can dive into writing actual code for it so the
              coding for that will be part of the challenge later. I did some
              first laytou work on the project but as much as I was hoping to do
              as I was spend more time working through the course and writing this
              blog which in way felt more important in the scope of the challenge.

            <p>
              <strong>Today's Progress:</strong> Styling galore and setting up the Sims Tracker project also set up git for my work
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> The day got away from me a little so it was late night, but I managed to get through my Fundamentals of CSS chapter as planned. And put some first CSS on my blog and it is starting to look a little nicer. In the CSS chapter there were quite a few things I was familiar with from some previous studying, but there were also some new things. Fro example the sticky positioning option was new to me. I also finally got a better understanding of positioning and of the clear property which was a bit of mystery to me before.
              I also finally set git up properly to track my work on the projects, but that is part of what was eating some of my time.
              For the Sims Tracker it got late to get on with the layout and to do some proper work on the landing page, so I just setup the webspace and wrote a little placeholder with some HTML and CSS.
              So I didn't get all my tasks done but I'm still happy with what did get done ine the end.
