        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
          Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet. i will be using
          this page to learn a little coding. I'm currently embarking on a
          <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com" target="_blank"
            >#100DaysOfCode</a
          >
          journey and I will be documenting this on here as well as use this as
          a practice piece.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this being a practice piece it will likely go through quiete a few
          changes over time so I hope you can bare with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          the current plan is to complete a Full stack developer course I'm doing
          on
          <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">CodeCademy</a>
          (which I do not count to the time for the 100 day challenge) and on
          the side practice what I learn on this block as well as on a a little
          project for tracking details about Sims in The Sims 4&#8482;. I know
          this might strike people as an odd choice of project but it is a
          franchise that has been close to my heart since it first released and
          I feel that there is a lot potential for me to practice a large number
          of technologies on it. Since I need to start with some layout work on
          that first I am starting my practice in this little blog.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the moment this will only be about my coding journey, but I will
          see if I add more other content to it eventually.

        <p>UPDATE (13/07/2022): There is a significant break after week 2 as I was struggling with my freshly diagnosed Crohns disease. I have done a little mor work on my coding and my little projects which I will write an update on for then picking up <a href="week3.html">week 3</a>. I am planning to ge back to doing some daily work and go back to documenting this in this blog type thing. as far as the work on the projcts go hopefully you should still get a fairly consistent idea about the work I hav done. Fingers crossed my health will get more stable so I can keep up the daily work going forward.</p>

              <strong>Today's Progress:</strong> Planned for the journey ahead
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> I think doing the CodeCademy course from
              the start and working on the Portfolio website is a good start. The
              Sims Tracker will be a bit of a left field thing to work on but I
              think I can work with a number of technologies of it and maybe some
              other plays find it useful in the end. I also need to have another
              look at my portfoliosite to se what I want to hange and to add the
              missing responsiveness.
            </p>
            <p>So essentially there will be 3 work streams:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>CodeCademy Full Stack Path</li>
              <li>Update and improve portfolio website</li>
              <li>Create Sims Tracker</li>
              <li>blog for direct practice documenting the journey</li>
            </ol>

              blog
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> I have completed the HTML chapter of my
              course, I really like the idea of the semantic tags. I have then
              used the HTML to start writing this little blog using those skills
              as my practice for the day.<br />My project, which will be a website
              to track details for Sims in The Sims 4&#8482;, still needs some
              layout work before I can dive into writing actual code for it so the
              coding for that will be part of the challenge later. I did some
              first laytou work on the project but as much as I was hoping to do
              as I was spend more time working through the course and writing this
              blog which in way felt more important in the scope of the challenge.

              <strong>Today's Progress:</strong> Styling galore and setting up the Sims Tracker project also set up git for my work
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> The day got away from me a little so it was late night, but I managed to get through my Fundamentals of CSS chapter as planned. And put some first CSS on my blog and it is starting to look a little nicer. In the CSS chapter there were quite a few things I was familiar with from some previous studying, but there were also some new things. Fro example the sticky positioning option was new to me. I also finally got a better understanding of positioning and of the clear property which was a bit of mystery to me before.
              I also finally set git up properly to track my work on the projects, but that is part of what was eating some of my time.
              For the Sims Tracker it got late to get on with the layout and to do some proper work on the landing page, so I just setup the webspace and wrote a little placeholder with some HTML and CSS.
              So I didn't get all my tasks done but I'm still happy with what did get done ine the end.

            <p>
              <strong>Today's Progress:</strong> First "free"(or local) Codecademy project and proper start on Sims Tracker project.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> I have done the chapters on my course that I planned to do, but they were mostly things I was already aware of, but in the end there was a little project in create a website as per a give example and specs which was a nice exercise and I will link the result in the link here.<br>
              I have done more work on the Sims Tracker landing page and but I will leave the place holder page in place  at the domain until some actual functionality is in place there. So if you want to follow along with the progress I will post updates and pictures here or you can follow along on my github account. So this what hte landing page looks like now. The little banner oin the header is not ideal just yet but I did not want to spend a ton of time on the picture and get to working on the code.The next step putting a sign up form below then this piece will be done in its static form and I can move on to the next part.
            </p>
            <img src="images/landing-page-day3-satus.png" alt="Sims Tracker Landing Day 3 Status">
            <p>Yes I said a sign up form and yes there is a login button at the top right there. I think the actual functionality for those is still realatively far in the future, but I do want this to be something people can actually use so it'll need some kind of account system and database behind it. While this is somewhat intimidating at this point in time, learning how to make that work is something I really look forward to and part of why I chose this project.<br>
            So Overall I would have liked to get a bit more work done on sprucing up this blog, but sometimes the days are just not long enough. SO I didn't get everything done but I'm happy with the things I did get done.</p>

              <strong>Today's Progress:</strong> CSS colors and typography; Forms without function.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> I have not gotten too much done today, as I had some doctors apointments and I need to recover from the last couple of late nights of coding.
              I have done some good work on the simstracker though reactivating coding my knowledge about forms to create the sign up form on the landing page. I want to put a little more polish on it tomorrow by putting a green frame on the active input box. I can't quite remeber how that worked, but I recall that it was possible, so I will have a look at that tomorrow. The page looks like this now:
            </p>
            <img src="images/landing-page-day4-status.png" alt="Sims Tracker Landing Day 4 Status">
            <p>For the Course work I have done more CSS mostly on colors and typography which was mostly familiar but still good to re-do and reactivate the knowledge. I'm planning to finish the chapter tomorrow it's quite a a long one though but I want to get out of the familiar zone so I can take another shot at under JavaScript.<br>
            I think the work on polishing the blog and planning the portfolio revamp will have to wait till over the weekend. I need to get better at gauging how much work I can get done in a day. I don't like these half finished lists! I think I will also have to start bundling the days up for the blog in some improvised from of pagination to keep some sort of order.</p>

              <strong>Today's Progress:</strong> Slow day, not much done.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> It's been a slow da on the code front. There was a lot going on thorugh ut the day, so I did not get to spend nearly as mch time as I would have liked with coding or learning. <br>
              Therefore not much progress on the course, but ome interesting pointers into making sure that clickable elements are recognised as such and how to best do that. I did do some small bits of work on the nave to split the journal and projet/challenge nav elemenets. I have also decided that once the first 7 days are done I will bundel the journal entries into weeks to make some sort readable pagination.<br>
              On The Sims trackers I merely made some changes to the login in and sign up button to make them more 'buttony" and I added a border change to the active inputfields. Again not much but all I had time for today.<br>
              I shall make up for missed time tomorrow.

            <p>
              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> First things first, yes I was naughty and skipped a day. I just needed some rest after what has been a busy a week and still recovering from being so poorly for a rather long time. But baack in full force today. <br>
              I have finished the next CSS chapter all about tables, form and font. I took that and used to work on the Sims Tracker project writing the HTML for the login page and changing the Sign up form. to nest the text input into the lable element, which I have never done before but saw in the course and found rather elegant.<br>
              I also made use of the tables when setting up the dashboard with as static page with made up examples. the structure and layout for it still need work though.<br>
              It is coming together, so I'm happy.

              <strong>Today's Progress:</strong> Studying grids and working on layouts
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Thoughts:</strong> Today was overall a bit lighter on programming but I have learned much about grids which I plan to put to work for the Sims Tracker tomorrow. <br>
              I have done a fair amount of concept work today. With a tool called Figma. I'm so far really happy using it for working out the concepts. I shall put these into prcatice over the next couple of days.
